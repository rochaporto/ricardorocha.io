Setting up a VPN would be an easy and obvious choice but this is currently not an option at work. Alternatively and after suggestions from multiple people a combination of ssh / proxy setup and a handy browser extension and the result is close enough.
Ignore all the GSSAPI* below if you don&#39;t require Kerberos or similar access.</description></item><item><title>Analysing Prometheus Metrics in Pandas</title><link>https://ricardorocha.io/blog/prometheus-metrics-in-pandas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ricardorocha.io/blog/prometheus-metrics-in-pandas/</guid><description>I spend more and more time working with Prometheus as it&#39;s the default monitoring / metric collection system for Kubernetes clusters at work and other projects i have. It&#39;s also a great tool overall i wish i had for longer. Pair it with Grafana and it gives a well integrated monitoring solution: While a lot can be done with the timeseries data using PromQL and Grafana, i often miss Pandas to easily reorganize the data.</description></item><item><title>Custom Containerd Versions in GKE Clusters</title><link>https://ricardorocha.io/blog/gke-custom-containerd/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ricardorocha.io/blog/gke-custom-containerd/</guid><description>GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) is a strong option for managed Kubernetes cluster deployments, backed by the Google Cloud Platform. Relying on managed services reduces the maintenance overhead and building on features such as auto-repair and auto-upgrade is also a plus.
In some rare cases more flexibility is required, usually involving an early or very experimental feature in a critical component. In this case, we need a more recent version of containerd.</description></item><item><title>Managing Builds and Releases with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://ricardorocha.io/blog/managing-builds-and-releases-with-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2019 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ricardorocha.io/blog/managing-builds-and-releases-with-github-actions/</guid><description>I&#39;ve been a longtime user of Travis CI, specifically for a pet project managing gliding flights parsing and analysis - that in the past had iterations in Java and Python and has for several years been written in Go.
With recent talk about GitHub Actions and also seeing that a couple of new projects in the containers area seem to be using it, i decided to give this a go. The first results are pretty good and in this post i&#39;ll describe what&#39;s available and how to use this functionality to:</description></item></channel></rss>
