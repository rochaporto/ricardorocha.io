# About Me

I'm a Computing Engineer working at [CERN](https://home.cern) - the European Organization for Nuclear Research - in Geneva, Switzerland. I help store and analyse large amounts of data and focus on cloud related technologies, especially containerized deployments and networking. More recently i've also started working on infrastructure to scale out machine learning workloads.

I enjoy learning and building new things, using new programming languages and tools and helping them grow and scale to the needs of large scientific and research projects. My past work included development and deployment of data storage systems and monitoring tools.

Open source projects i use and contribute to include OpenStack, Kubernetes and Docker. I also maintain a few small projects, you can find more information on this website.

I enjoy flying gliders and small planes, mountain climbing, hiking and seeing the world.

I will try to write about all of the above.
