The [IGC (International Gliding Comission) format](http://igc.com) is widely used by gliding and paragliding flight recorders, analysis and visualization software. It captures tracks as a sequence of timed GPS coordinates, along with extra flight metadata. Here's an example flight track overlayed on a map:
{{% figure src="../../images/post/flight-track-map.png"
      class="figcaption"
      caption="Track of gliding flight over the French and Swiss Alps"
%}}

Calculating the total flight distance is a trivial task, we just sum the great circle distance between every two consecutive points. But such a number is of limited interest as it doesn't take into account the area covered by a flight, which is where the challenge lies. For this reason pilots, whether comparing performance of their leisure flights in online contests or during official competitions, prefer to calculate flight distance considering a number of turnpoints, with some types having specific names.

* **Out and Return**: 1 turnpoint
* **Triangle**: 2 turnpoints
* **FAI Triangle**: 2 turnpoints, with the shortest side being at least 28% of the total
* **3, 4 or more turnpoints**: no specific names

{{% figure src="../../images/story/vaga-wavecamp.jpg"
      class="figcaption"
      caption="French glider in Norway, on the way up to 21000 feet ( -40 Â°C )"
%}}

This calculation is an optimization problem where we try to find the maximum for a certain score function considering the restrictions above.

A possible implementation is to evaluate every possible combination, which guarantees an optimal result but is O(n^m) - with *n* being the number of recorded GPS points and *m* the number of desired turnpoints. Long flights often record several thousand GPS coordinates, so this naive approach quickly becomes prohibitive for even a low number of turnpoints.

In the first part of the series we look at at this approach and how we can use the excellent Go tools to try to optimize our code. The next entries will look how domain knowledge can help simplify the task, and cover faster and more efficient approximative solutions such as shortest path, simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, but where a global optimum is not always guaranteed.

Depending on available time to experiment with other algorithms, this series risks to be a trilogy extended to many more parts.

### Brute Force

Here's what a loop over all possible combinations for 1 turnpoint could look like:
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
var optimalDistance float64
var distance float64
var task Task
var optimalTask Task

for i := 0; i < len(track.Points)-2; i++ {
	for j := i + 1; j < len(track.Points)-1; j++ {
		for z := j + 1; z < len(track.Points); z++ {
			task = Task{
				Start:      track.Points[i],
				Turnpoints: []Point{track.Points[j]},
				Finish:     track.Points[z],
			}
			distance = task.Distance()
			if distance > optimalDistance {
				optimalDistance = distance
				optimalTask = Task(task)
			}
		}
	}
}
return optimalTask, nil

The results are disappointing, given we're calculating a 1 turnpoint maximum for a flight with around 1000 points:

You've probably already noticed a couple obvious issues with the code above, but let's look at the pprof output for hints:

We would expect this process to be dominated by math calculations for the distances, but this doesn't seem to be the case. Between the Task and Point distance computation we see ~70% of the time spent in memory allocation and slices. A quick look at the Task.Distance() function shows the issue:
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
func (task *Task) Distance() float64 {
	d := 0.0
	p := []Point{task.Start}
	p = append(p, task.Turnpoints...)
	p = append(p, task.Finish)
	for i := 0; i < len(p)-1; i++ {
		d += p[i].Distance(p[i+1])
	}
	return d
}
{{< /highlight >}}

We could hardly do any worse than allocating a single item array and extending it for each item, in a function that is called on every loop. This makes it a bit better:
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
func (task *Task) Distance() float64 {
	d := 0.0
	d += task.Start.Distance(task.Turnpoints[0])
	for i := 0; i < len(task.Turnpoints)-1; i++ {
		d += task.Turnpoints[i].Distance(task.Turnpoints[i+1])
	}
	d += task.Turnpoints[len(task.Turnpoints)-1].Distance(task.Finish)
	return d
}

Almost 2 times faster, but another look and it seems we still have memory allocation issues in the main loop (though the math functions start showing up on top, which is good):

Again, you probably noticed we're still creating a new Task on every loop. Avoiding useless allocations inside a loop always gives better results, we're now down to (showing the inner loop only):
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
		for z := j + 1; z < len(track.Points); z++ {
			task.Start = track.Points[i]
			task.Turnpoints[0] = track.Points[j]
			task.Finish = track.Points[z]
			distance = task.Distance()
			if distance > optimalDistance {
				optimalDistance = distance
				optimalTask = Task(task)
			}
		}

Most of the time is now spent on math operations.

#### Concurrency

If you've used Go you've read about concurrency by now. The language has great
primitives to simplify the task, and after the first simple code changes we
can try to execute the different steps concurrently and hope for a speed up.

Here's the sample code. We create a new go routine for each loop element, and
feed the results into a channel. These are later collected in a separate loop,
and the optimal result is calculated.

{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
	d := make(chan float64, len(track.Points)-2)
	t := make(chan Task, len(track.Points)-2)

	for i := 0; i < len(track.Points)-2; i++ {
		go func(i int) {
			var optimalDistance float64
			var distance float64
			var task Task
			var optimalTask Task

			task.Turnpoints = []Point{Point{}}
			optimalTask.Turnpoints = []Point{Point{}}
			for j := i + 1; j < len(track.Points)-1; j++ {
				for z := j + 1; z < len(track.Points); z++ {
					task.Start = track.Points[i]
					task.Turnpoints[0] = track.Points[j]
					task.Finish = track.Points[z]
					distance = task.Distance()
					if distance > optimalDistance {
						optimalDistance = distance
						optimalTask.Start = track.Points[i]
						optimalTask.Turnpoints[0] = track.Points[j]
						optimalTask.Finish = track.Points[z]
					}
				}
			}
			d <- optimalDistance
			t <- optimalTask
		}(i)
	}

	for i := 0; i < len(track.Points)-2; i++ {
		distance = <-d
		task = <-t
		if distance > optimalDistance {
			optimalDistance = distance
			optimalTask = task
		}
	}
{{< /highlight >}}

How does it look?
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
aaaa
{{< /highlight >}}

The result is terrible, and it can hang the box pretty quickly. The reason for
this is the number of go routines we're launching - too many results in too
much context switching and little work done. But how many go routines should we be
launching? We can look at what sounds reasonable, but to debug this sort of
cases Go provides a tool called tracer, and we can instruct our tests to
generate a trace:
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}

{{< /highlight >}}

{{% figure src="../../images/post/bruteforce_optimize_o3.png"
      class="figcaption"
%}}

This visualization is clearly telling us our cores are often idle, again
a sign we might be doing too much context switching. We can reduce the number
of go routines by moving the routine launch up in the nested loops:
{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}

{{< /highlight >}}

Here's the new trace visualization, and the matching benchmark results:
{{% figure src="../../images/post/bruteforce_optimize_o4.png"
      class="figcaption"
%}}

This looks much better.

{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}

{{< /highlight >}}
```

Further optimizations can be done by reducing the number of calculations, and there are a few options available:

* Cache distances between points, as the loop often recomputes values for the same two points
* *Clean* the flight at the start, removing any redundant points (overlapping or too close to each other)
* Stop a loop once the points left cannot give a better solution than the current max (more complex, we'll cover it below)

#### Caching

We've seen that most time in now spent on math calculations, which are quite
expensive. The next step is then to reduce their number, and caching is one way
of doing it. Here's the code:

{{< highlight go "hl_lines=2 3" >}}
func (b *bruteForceOptimizer) optimize1(track Track, score Score) (Task, error) {

	var optimalDistance float64
	var distance float64
	var optimalTask Task

	cache := make([][]float64, len(track.Points))
	for i := range track.Points {
		cache[i] = make([]float64, len(track.Points))
	}
	var d1, d2 float64
	for i := 0; i < len(track.Points)-2; i++ {
		for j := i + 1; j < len(track.Points)-1; j++ {
			for z := j + 1; z < len(track.Points); z++ {
				if cache[i][j] != 0 {
					d1 = cache[i][j]
				} else {
					d1 = track.Points[i].Distance(track.Points[j])
					cache[i][j] = d1
				}
				if cache[j][z] != 0 {
					d2 = cache[j][z]
				} else {
					d2 = track.Points[j].Distance(track.Points[z])
					cache[j][z] = d2
				}
				distance = d1 + d2
				if distance > optimalDistance {
					optimalDistance = distance
					optimalTask = Task{Start: track.Points[i],
						Turnpoints: []Point{track.Points[j]}, Finish: track.Points[z]}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return optimalTask, nil
}

We're now at a 7x improvement compared to our first attempt.

* + Always shows the global optimum
* - Very slow for long flights and high number of turnpoints
* - Potential optimizations make the code harder to read

Later we'll dive into optimization algorithms (montecarlo, genetic, and funny
nature inspired ones). But next we look at how we can further improve by using
domain knowledge to simplify the problem, also considering [the fastest code is
the code that never
runs](http://www.ilikebigbits.com/2015_12_06_gauntlet.html).
